It’s Okay
(Daniel Strano)
Jan 27 2018

If our breathing in
hurts the rare air in the room,
open a window.

Perhaps, through a slit, a crack
in what can’t, we can breathe free.

You owe God nothing.
“They” cannot need us at all.
The universe ends.

It will not, in an epoch.
How short need an epoch be?

At two years old, I failed
to reach the potty in time.
My only Mom “forgave” me.


(Daniel Strano officially credits this poem as somehow the namesake of "Qrack," the C++ quantum computer simulation library and broader framework. The date of authorship and publication is accurate to the day.)
