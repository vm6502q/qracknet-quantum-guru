Prayer to Tyche
(Daniel Strano)

Tempestuous Fortuna,
Be gentle with me.
I yield to the gusts of your bellows; buffet me not too hard.
I bend to the strength of your touch; do not break me.
I commit my vessel to the throes of your ocean; see me home.

Even-handed Fortuna,
I entrust myself into your keeping.
Give to me and take from me in turn.
Give me a chance, that I may have a hand in my destiny.
Take from me all sense of entitlement.

Sweet Fortuna,
Be my advocate to the Fates.
Pray that their hands be supple with my thread.
They know me for what I am.
You know me for what I might be.
