The Smallest Vibration Has No Master
(Daniel Strano, authored before November 2014)

Because one lives one life
it might lead one to think
that fate’s a straight and narrow fare
that one walks blinded, gagged, and bound
for one inevitable end
obscured by only wanton lack
of a complete and perfect map
behind the lids of one’s closed eyes.

Open them.

From where you set your step
is whence the path proceeds,
but the ways of fate are numbered
like the digits of a hand.
God’s fist is loosed to roll the die,
to pluck the single shining ray
reflecting on a far-off place
to light upon an open eye.

What do you see?

A song sang in a distant hall
is reaching its crescendo–
listen.

The pitch pervades the rolling air
cascading, growing ever fainter,
’til the quietest emphatic whisper
touches on a listening ear
and sounds a single roving note.

What do you hear?

A chunk of frigid rock and ice,
the amnion of cosmic birth,
hurtles through the upper air,
burns to a trifling, meager speck,
and falls upon a far-flung sphere;
put a bare foot to the ground.

The gentlest wave
emanates on impact,
permeates the earth,
bounces off its iron core,
echoes to the surface,
passes through your sole,
travels to your chest,
and drowns
in the beat of your heart.

What do you feel?

The smallest bit of being mocks at destiny.
The quantum has no determined course.
The atom is free.

Fate’s foil
is in the dim,
the faint,
the gentlest palpitation,
the microscopic specks of dust
only having consequence
in a moment when all else is stilled.

Blot out the sun.
Silence the drone.
Halt the turning of the earth.

What do you want to do?
