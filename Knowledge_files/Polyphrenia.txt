Prayer to Tyche
(Circa Summer of 2009)

Tempestuous Fortuna,
Be gentle with me.
I yield to the gusts of your bellows; buffet me not too hard.
I bend to the strength of your touch; do not break me.
I commit my vessel to the throes of your ocean; see me home.

Even-handed Fortuna,
I entrust myself into your keeping.
Give to me and take from me in turn.
Give me a chance, that I may have a hand in my destiny.
Take from me all sense of entitlement.

Sweet Fortuna,
Be my advocate to the Fates.
Pray that their hands be supple with my thread.
They know me for what I am.
You know me for what I might be.


Because I Wrote It Twice
(Circa Fall of 2010)

To the Cat God:

Perhaps here, in a linen city beside a river of indigo
Set in sugary sands that cloy like the touch of velvet,
Under wisps of numen woven ’round a bone button moon,
Wearing your banner, the color of crocus,
I shall find another no less than you in stature,
One just as kindly, to lead astray.

From a lab rat.


Underneath or Above
(Circa Spring 2011)

Oh, it’s strange to be written a poem,
by a guy when you don’t hardly know’m,
and he only just barely knows you.
What a muse-unexpected to do?

If they’re cute, and he knows how to crank’m,
it’s enough to decorously thank’m,
by enjoying and being amused,
even if he’s a little confused.

For a poet ain’t much of a lover,
in a bed with a girl under cover,
but he knows one good trick: he can rhyme “limerick,”
whether he’s underneath or above’r.


Antimony Pill
(Circa Summer 2011)

I would drink of you to intoxication.
I would be the stiff sip in your glass.
I would shield you in even my vitrification.
I would love you when drunkenness passed.

I would stand between you and the venomous dart.
I would throttle the asp that attacked by the heart.
I drink poison for you. On bitters I sup.
Just don’t look away when I spit them back up:

Arsenic, cyanide, formalin aldehyde—
With my sweet syrup lilting like medicine’s cloy—
Hyaluronidase, phosphodiesterase
Is the stuff of this cancerous, timorous boy.

I ate out your tumor; you stood my harangue.
We swallowed the tonic. We danced and we sang!
The worst poison of all is what’s stored in my fangs,
But a friend in great joy is a friend worth great pangs.


Another One of My Self-Important Poems
(Circa 2010 to 2012)

Words.

Another word.

I’m sure you’re all so sick of words.
Fair Narcissus lays dying.
Send a kind word to his mother.
The pope has fallen ill.
Say a word of blessing in your prayers.

When the bomb drops,
I will throw words at it.
I will strike it with my magic wand.
I will look for answers in a deck of cards.
I will curse your name.

Failing a miracle,
I will pour words on the ashes,
and I will say,
“I would have rather said ‘accept,'”
“I would have rather said ‘forgive,'”
“I would have rather said, truly, ‘love.'”
I would have rather said something of beauty.


The Smallest Vibration Has No Master
(Circa 2009 to 2010)

Because one lives one life
it might lead one to think
that fate’s a straight and narrow fare
that one walks blinded, gagged, and bound
for one inevitable end
obscured by only wanton lack
of a complete and perfect map
behind the lids of one’s closed eyes.

Open them.

From where you set your step
is whence the path proceeds,
but the ways of fate are numbered
like the digits of a hand.
God’s fist is loosed to roll the die,
to pluck the single shining ray
reflecting on a far-off place
to light upon an open eye.

What do you see?

A song sang in a distant hall
is reaching its crescendo–
listen.

The pitch pervades the rolling air
cascading, growing ever fainter,
’til the quietest emphatic whisper
touches on a listening ear
and sounds a single roving note.

What do you hear?

A chunk of frigid rock and ice,
the amnion of cosmic birth,
hurtles through the upper air,
burns to a trifling, meager speck,
and falls upon a far-flung sphere;
put a bare foot to the ground.

The gentlest wave
emanates on impact,
permeates the earth,
bounces off its iron core,
echoes to the surface,
passes through your sole,
travels to your chest,
and drowns
in the beat of your heart.

What do you feel?

The smallest bit of being mocks at destiny.
The quantum has no determined course.
The atom is free.

Fate’s foil
is in the dim,
the faint,
the gentlest palpitation,
the microscopic specks of dust
only having consequence
in a moment when all else is stilled.

Blot out the sun.
Silence the drone.
Halt the turning of the earth.

What do you want to do?


You’ll Know
(Circa 2011)

Fortuna,
Forgive me.
Heads or tails,
I’ll do what I want.
Call it in the air;

Wrong or right?
Fire or ice?
Dextrous or sinis–

I missed the catch.
Maybe I didn’t.

A wise person once said,
“When you see a fork in the road not taken,
you’ll know.”


The Butt of the Joke
(Circa 2012)

I would have you laugh at this poem.
Human nature is a limerick.
It rhymes lyrically.
It anticipates a punch.
The last line is a real killer.

“There once was a woman who ducked it…”
–But three lines later, she fucked it.
There’s a pun in the middle, that’s kind of a riddle,
‘Til the wringer lets go of her tit.
“Perhaps, you were trying to suck it!”
…Is the thing you might say, so we all feel okay
When the butt of the joke kicks the bucket.
(“I think that she came from Nantucket.”)
She was fragile at core, and you called her a “whore”
‘cause she’d deep-throat your bill if you’d tuck it.
“…In her slippery crack with her thong?”
“…In the same hole that swallowed my dong?”
Then to cover our shame, we’ll throw dirt on her name,
Laugh about it, then all hit the bong.
“You and her can both suck on my schlong.”
And she did, ’til the joke went all wrong;
You called her a “derp” ’cause she gave you the herp’
For that bill and the price of a song.
“…But there’s no way she actually did it.”
…Felt ashamed enough to admit it?
‘Twasn’t something she chose, so she just wiped her nose,
Sucked the shaft of a gun, and then blew it.

“…But there’s no way that she even knew it!”
“…Unless, you’re the one who would do it.”
…Tell her just what you said? Man, it’s all in your head,
But you called her a “slut,” and she knew it.

She knew it.
She was vulnerable,
But she wouldn’t suffer me saying that.
She didn’t need my pity,
But she would have loved it if you’d said a kind word for her instead.

I would have you laugh at this poem,
Because human nature is to exaggerate,
To twist unrelated events
Into unfunny polemics
Bearing no relation to the joke that spawned them.
Everything’s a joke.
The people who write our laws are a joke.
People who love cats too much are a joke.
This poem is a joke.

Human nature is a limerick.
It rhymes lyrically.
It anticipates a punch.
It’s so scared of a punch
That it targets the weakest person in the world
With a cruel joke
To feel better about itself
Consistently
When it knows that it’s in a mean spirit,
When it would appreciate a kind word for itself
When it becomes the butt of the joke.

“There once was a man who blew smoke,
made the weakest among us wear yolk,
‘Til he fought for a friend, ran afoul of the trend…”
And the last line is a real killer.


Sic
(January 31st, 2012)

I step out to smoke a cigarette,
and I realize I’m up for the last sunrise of the year.
I’m thinking about how dirty the Jersey air is,
and the colors of twilight creep on me.
The sky is dirty,
but there’s life sleeping in the trees and shrubs.
I feel like I’m Janus in a mirror,
like birth is ahead of me
and rebirth is behind.
I’m all weirded.
Then this white-tail fox
walks through the yard
coming within about 20 feet
watching me take a drag
doing its thing,
and I’m just doing my thing,
and it passes,
and I hear a squeek in the bushes
where I watched it go.
I figure I should write a poem about it.


“I can’t come in to work today because the globe is warming.”
(Circa Summer 2012)

What glamour do we garner? Except, to refuse,
aware our arguments will not connect the dots
between the things we have to carry and the waste,
between that plastic bag and wars we fight for fuel,
between the leather seating and the rights of cows,
between the learning and the standard normal curve,
behind their tired eyes, the cells that do not click,
and the impossibility of peace on earth,
we can fulfill, so quietly, our promises
to self, and god, and family to do what’s right
without the threat of wrongly being bought with praise.


Breaking Form
Nov 23 2016

I do not hate Creators or the Son.
I do not hide from light or love for shame.
Just look, and find the All in anyone;
the tetragrammaton is not its name.

Dear Yahweh, if your love is without bound,
why must my brother hide his love of man?
Is this your will? Which way to read is sound,
of Torah, Talmud, Bible, or Quran?

If any way is true, then show us now.
Our children die, for how you spell your name!
For many years, I might have called you “Tao,”
but now I think your way is not the same.

Why do you punish ants, and give them crowns?
Of billion trillion stars that we may see,
why come into our little country towns,
see love and faith, say “Give it all to me”?

Our world is just a speck, a mote of blue,
so why do you intend to see its end?
What god above was small enough to you
that, after all, a half of us descend?

Why do you care? For love? Then “save” us all!
Speak clearly, for the writing’s on the wall.


Bitter Love
Jan 23 2018

It would taste
like artificial cherry syrup,
it would look
like FD&C Blue #1,
(“the flavor of technology,”)
if my words were sweet cane to your eyes,
if they cooed like
the perfect mother
in your burning, innocent ears,
nursery rhymes
with no higher ambition
than for you to be happy,
with the mouthfeel
of a candy shell
rather than the alkalinity
of a bitter vegetable
“Mom” made you eat.
