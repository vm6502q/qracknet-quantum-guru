Selected Haiku and Tanka
Daniel Strano


1. Disarmed
Aug 03 2015 

Anonymity
the poem’s essence slashes;
the Te is to cut.


2. Sour Candy
Nov 25 2016

A sweet lemon drop
can make my raw tongue retract.
I don’t taste acid.


3. Whether You Want To
May 21 2017

The sun stays up late,
listening to the birds’ songs,
like a teen dressed black.

Isn’t it past your bedtime?
How old do I have to be?

Even the robins
chide the “old boy” to grow up.
Master your tongue, first.

I am unsure, like wading
headfirst in the Lethe’s head.

I have two tokens.
I don’t know if I earned them;
Charon doesn’t care.

Where is the ferry destined?
Can a friend take my silver?

Two cents for your eyes
are your first, most basic right,
but keep them open!

One cannot choose their own birth,
nor ask the unborn, “To be?”

The father of life
leaves us without light or heat.
Mother, where are you?

I do not hear your children,
just their toys speeding away.

Accelerating
too fast down a slow, dark road,
we’re easy to miss.

It’s true: the greater our speed,
the less our perfect clocks tick.

A young, naive heart
sees one too many sunsets
and ceases beating.

This is not how it all ends,
a false light in the tunnel.

The morning after,
you might rise, with wounds stitched shut,
whether you want to.


4. Do-or-Die
Aug 13 2017

Armies of crickets
advance, retreat, and regroup,
but won’t surrender.

Heat relents. The first leaves fall.
I will yield when the sun dies.

You said, “I cannot,”
your back turned to the sunset.
Then, you were silent.

I stared til my eyes burned out.
Blind, I threw rocks at the sun.

I did not expect
to upend Heaven’s order;
it’s a chance in Hell.

Tell me God decrees winter;
tell me seasons cannot change!

Tides change direction,
on the Normandy beaches.
It couldn’t happen.


5. Inappropiate Dress
Jan 24 2018

One rainy morning,
lying beneath the cool sheets,
no one will hear me.

It is not your fault, in truth,
that I have damaged my voice.

Some rain has to fall;
sunny days are not enough
for flowers to grow.

At black January’s end,
we should expect two cold months.

I know the T-shirts
bother my peers as much as
me wearing a coat.


6. Without Right
Jan 24 2018

I study Her form
for my snow white angles,
cold, blunt thievery.

This weather is farcical.
You should hear it on the news.

It’s not that the globe
isn’t on fire, today,
nor haven’t I smoked.

It is not my time to blow
rings in the face of my death.

I’ve never listened
to those who have insisted
it’s time to give up.

In a moment of weakness,
I would hide from your power.

Formalities exchanged,
sympathies given back,
Your absence would remain.


7. It’s Okay
Jan 27 2018

If our breathing in
hurts the rare air in the room,
open a window.

Perhaps, through a slit, a crack
in what can’t, we can breathe free.

You owe God nothing.
“They” cannot need us at all.
The universe ends.

It will not, in an epoch.
How short need an epoch be?

At two years old, I failed
to reach the potty in time.
My only Mom “forgave” me.

[Editor's note: Daniel Strano officially credits "It's Okay" as somehow the namesake of "Qrack," the C++ quantum computer simulation library and broader framework. The date of authorship and publication is accurate to the day.]


8. 10-0
Jan 29 2018

I could not tell you
from my deaf imagining
if I heard its voice.

Our ears are played on daily.
Shadows disappear at night.

So long, I have lived
unsure of me, in the dark.
I saw you, and knew.

One thing, to see another,
must open its eyes and look.

I saw someone I knew.
I quietly heard her speak.
The jokes made sense, after.


9. Ts’ki
Nov 01 2018

One sentence of two
is twice unwritten by Fate,
whether it’s served:

Fire on ice, shaken, wanting
just us, alone, quiet, dark.

I have made my mind.
“Up to you. Forget me, not.”
I take my chances.

There is more than one option;
there are, to many, choices.

One may die innocent,
square as the day is round,
or live with guilt thereof.


10. Not Unaware
Jan 07 2019

My cat is dying
knowing more of how to be
than to be missed not.

To be missed; not to be missed:
pick your warmest vent, to sleep.

I live to sleep warm,
to fill time not unaware
with being itself.

“Happy” is at least “happy.”
I “learn” the point of her claws.

She knows that I love her;
she knows she will fall down;
she knows I can’t catch her.


11. Point-Like
Apr 06 2019

You wrote twenty words,
about a letter, or so,
in an open box.

You could write them in large type.
The words were big, if they fit.

Smart men made the box.
They knew little boxes fit
everything big.

Those men made lots of money,
putting us in small boxes.

The boxes got smaller,
and they made more money,
on our open boxes.


12. Keep It
Apr 06 2019

Bright April morning
blows birdsong through my screen door.
What a way to wake!

Half-aware of its insides,
I gather my form’s edges.

Something exploded
in a place no one visits,
last night in Heaven.

You can keep the things that pass,
in pitch, in an empty jar.

Open it to the sun:
I do not have reason
to empty my ashes.


13. The Apple
(Written and published before 2015)

I bit the apple,
sweeter than white, refined cane,
sweeter than nature.

We all ate apples.
We experienced apples,
each one different.

We were different.
We experienced apples
spontaneously.

I traveled the world,
experiencing apples,
like Gandhi Lennon.

My friend grew apples.
He said, “You can grow apples,”
but, why are they free?
